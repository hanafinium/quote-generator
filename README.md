# quote-generator or QTG (Subject to change)

The purpose of QTG is to serve as a browser homepage and hopefully help users start their day on a high note. QTG follows a minimalistic design concept that is easy on the eyes and does not overwhelm. QTG will display a different QOTD (quote of the day) daily, fetched from the Quotes REST API(https://quotes.rest/). Users will also be served daily birthday reminders (coming soon) and current temperature.
