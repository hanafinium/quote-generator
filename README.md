# quote-generator or QTG (Subject to change)
The purpose of QTG is to serve as a browser homepage and hopefully help users start their day on a high note. QTG follows a minimalistic design concept that is easy on the eyes and does not overwhelm. QTG serves users with a QOTD (Quote of the Day) and also allows users to generate more quotes if they wish to do so.
