# quote-generator or QTG (Subject to change)

The purpose of QTG is to serve as a browser homepage and hopefully help users start their day on a high note. QTG follows a minimalistic design concept that is easy on the eyes and does not overwhelm. QTG will display a different QOTD (quote of the day) daily, fetched from the Quotes REST API(https://quotes.rest/). Weather data fetched from the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/api).
